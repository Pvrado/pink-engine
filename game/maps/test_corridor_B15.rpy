    Scaling doesn't always look nice, as you can probably see from some of the objects in this room.

    For complex objects, you'd want to keep the scaling differences to a minimum, just enough to provide some variety
    (see pillars on bottom right of room).

    Simple objects can more easily be scaled without artifacts (see shadow on the left hand of room)."""
